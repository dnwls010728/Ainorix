# Prebuilt Android runtime

`<abi>/liboe_player.so` is the NativeActivity game player. `oe package --android`
combines it with a game's assets, manifest and resources, so packaging needs
no NDK. APK signing still needs SDK build-tools and Java; App Bundle signing
needs Java.

- ABIs: `arm64-v8a` (phones/tablets), `x86_64` (emulators).
- Built on 2026-10-02 with Android NDK r28c (28.2.13676358), Clang 19.0.1,
  Release, API 26, static libc++, GLES3 and AAudio.
- Source: 91fd4d5 (P3.2 particle billboards, on combined P1/P2/P3.1). Includes
  persistent saves, skeletal animation and shared 2D/3D camera-facing particles
  with lifetime size/color/opacity, texture sheet frames and transparent ordering.
  Both ABIs rebuilt successfully without new warnings. Android device execution
  of this milestone remains unverified.
- ELF load segments are aligned to 16 KB; `oe_ANativeActivity_onCreate` is
  exported. Android 15 x86_64 emulator verification is recorded in
  [docs/ANDROID.md](../../docs/ANDROID.md).

## When to rebuild

Rebuild after changing engine C++ used by the player. The runtime is shared
by every game, so it does not need rebuilding for scene, Lua or asset edits.

```bat
set ANDROID_NDK_HOME=C:\path\to\android-ndk
build_android.bat
```

`build_android.bat` / `build_android.sh` build both ABIs by default and copy
them to `build/bin/android/` and this folder. Commit both libraries together
with the source change and update this document. Packaging prefers a local
build in `build/bin/android/` and falls back to this folder.

Physical arm64 hardware, audible output and 16 KB device execution remain
unverified; ELF/APK alignment was checked, which is not a device test.
