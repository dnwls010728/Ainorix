# Camera post-processing and shader materials

## Implementation status (work log)

P6 starts from integrated main. P3 rendering, P4 gamepads and P5 touch input
remain in independent PRs; none is a prerequisite for screen effects.

- [x] P6.1: Reflected PostProcess camera component and optional vignette in both
      renderers. Preserve default frame hashes, picking/depth, UI and selection
      overlays. Test API/serialization/undo and compare software/D3D11 output;
      regenerate shaders/API and refresh player runtimes.
      Windows Release passes 73 tests and Node/WASM passes 69. CameraPostProcessing
      covers neutral-frame identity, changed edge color, unaffected center/opaque
      UI/depth/IDs/selection outline, worker-thread determinism, serialization,
      undo/redo and resetting effects when switching cameras. Software/D3D11
      mean channel difference is 0.0122 of 255 on the comparison scene.
      Real Showcase CLI screenshots were inspected: off f41d641b55beb483,
      software vignette cac0b279d7c910b7, D3D11 c516b61d9ed5c27e.
      Shaders regenerated with sokol-shdc; web and both Android ABI players
      rebuilt. WebGL2/Android GPU execution of the effect remains pending.
- [ ] P6.2: Exposure/tone mapping and bloom, including required color-buffer
      precision, documented color-space behavior and available backend checks.
- [ ] P6.3: Optional FXAA and sample controls/demonstration; verify off/on output,
      resolution changes and separation from UI/selection overlays.
- [ ] P6.4: Custom shader materials through commands/assets, validation and
      portable backend shader generation. Document the software reference
      behavior and demonstrate a material in a sample.
- [ ] Hardware follow-up: Android device and full Linux/EGL effect execution.

## Initial contract

Attach PostProcess to a Camera entity. Only the active game camera selects its
settings; free/editor Scene cameras start with effects disabled. All effects
default off so existing screenshots and scene files retain their behavior.
The scene color is processed before UI and the selection outline, keeping
controls and editor feedback readable. Depth and entity IDs remain unchanged.

The first milestone implements vignette only. Strength 0..1 darkens the image
edges; radius is measured in normalized screen coordinates (center 0, midpoint
of an edge 1, corner sqrt(2)). Softness is the transition width, with a minimum
of 0.01 to avoid a degenerate smooth transition. Subsequent milestones add the
other effects and custom materials; P6 is not complete until those are verified.

## Vignette controls

Use component.add/component.set on the camera (and the same scene.set calls in
Lua); reflection supplies serialization, undo and the editor inspector.

```json
{"command":"component.add","args":{"id":"Camera","type":"PostProcess","values":{"vignette":0.8,"vignetteRadius":0.3,"vignetteSoftness":0.5}}}
```

Defaults are vignette 0, radius 0.75 and softness 0.5. Reflected ranges are
0..1, 0..1.5 and 0.01..2 respectively. Direct RenderView settings are normalized
at rendering time; non-finite values fall back to safe defaults. The vignette
multiplies scene display-color channels by a cubic smoothstep falloff before
overlays. This milestone does not introduce HDR lighting or tone mapping.
